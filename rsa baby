# 🕵️‍♀️ Ringzer0Team — RSA Baby Challenge Write-Up

**By Celestine a.k.a. C0MIC 🔐**

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Challenge:** A ZIP file contained an RSA-encrypted flag and a private key.

**Result:** Successfully decrypted the flag:

```
FLAG-vOAM5ZcReMNzJqOfxLauakHx
```

---

## 🧩 The Setup (what I found)

File: `e2c9757d48bd69a357a78223dd4a2bd1.zip`

Attempting to unzip produced this error:

```
checkdir error:  flag exists but is not directory
```

Turns out there was already a file named `flag` in the working directory — the archive wanted to create a **directory** called `flag/`.

---

## 🛠️ Fixing the extraction (commands I ran)

I removed the conflicting file and re-extracted the archive:

```bash
rm flag
unzip e2c9757d48bd69a357a78223dd4a2bd1.zip
ls flag
# -> flag.enc  private.pem
```

Inside `flag/`:

* `private.pem` → RSA private key (PEM)
* `flag.enc` → encrypted flag

---

## 🔐 Decryption

This is a standard RSA decryption with the provided private key. I used OpenSSL to perform the decryption.

**Command used:**

```bash
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey flag/private.pem -in flag/flag.enc
```

If OpenSSL complains (e.g. `RSA operation error`), the alternative is:

```bash
openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey flag/private.pem -in flag/flag.enc
```

One of these commands returned the plaintext flag printed to the terminal.

## 🏁 The Flag

```text
FLAG-vOAM5ZcReMNzJqOfxLauakHx
```

## 🧠 Lessons & Notes (for future you)

* Always check for filename conflicts before extracting archives.
* A `.pem` file usually indicates an RSA key — look for `BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY`.
* `openssl rsautl` is handy for simple RSA ops; `openssl pkeyutl` supports additional formats/padding.
* Keep private keys safe. If someone shares a private key in a challenge, you can decrypt the data directly — but in real life, *never* expose private keys.

## ✨ Final thoughts

This was a great beginner-friendly RSA challenge: short, instructive, and satisfying to finish. If you want, I can convert this into a nicely formatted `README.md` file, add badges, or create a short screencast showing the commands.
